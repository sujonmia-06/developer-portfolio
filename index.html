        <p class="top-paragraph">
          I used to work as a Barista in a well known cafe in Bangladesh. I was
          a Professional Barista Trainer also. I compleated my graduation on BBA
          from Dhaka International University. Programming used to call me from
          a long ago. But time didn't let me start. Now here I am, started to
          learn programming. InShaAllah I will achive my goal one day sooner or
          later. Because I have a long way to go.

            They didn't offer me a job. But I made myself as a remove web
            developer. I made their website and showed it to them. They liked
            it. And uploaded the content. It was fun working at Programming
            Hero.
