        <h3>Ex-Barista and Web Developer</h3>
        <p>
          I used to work as a Barista in a well known cafe in Bangladesh. I was
          a Professional Barista Trainer also. I compleated my graduation on BBA
          from Dhaka International University. Programming used to call me from
          a long ago. But time didn't let me start. Now here I am, started to
          learn programming. InShaAllah I will achive my goal one day sooner or
          later. Because I have a long way to go.
